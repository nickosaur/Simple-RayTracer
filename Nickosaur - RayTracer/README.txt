Compilation : Just open the solution on your VS and it should work.

No acceleration structure as I implemented this project by myself.
Due to time constraints and finals, I couldn't get the reflections working
properly for scene6 :( and the direction light doesnt seem to be right for scene5...
Not sure about the difference in hot pixels for specular since I already made sure they
would pass through center of each pixel. Please be lenient with the grading :(

Thank you.
